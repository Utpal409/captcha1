## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#666699) for a sophisticated and professional feel, referencing the analytical nature of data processing. This color works well to project reliability without being a cliché blue.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEF1), subtly desaturated from the primary, providing a clean backdrop that allows content to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted Violet (#957DAD), adds a touch of sophistication and highlights key interactive elements without overwhelming the interface. It is distinct in both saturation and brightness, while still feeling analogous to the primary.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font suitable for both headlines and body text, known for its clean and modern appearance which enhances readability and is ideal for presenting technical information.
- Simple, geometric icons for actions like 'Fetch', 'Copy', and different data formats (JSON, HTML, Text).
- Clean, minimalist layout with clear sections for input, data display, and options.
- Subtle animations (e.g., a loading spinner) to indicate data fetching in progress.
